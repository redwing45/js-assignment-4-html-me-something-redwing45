      <h1>Introduction <img></h1>
      <main>
      <p id = "introduction"> I haven't been on a lot of trips, but Ive had some memorable experiances. I definitely need to go on more, 
         but I thought I would take the time to look back and rank which ones I liked the best, from 1-3, starting with my least favorite.</p>

         <h1>Dominican Republic</h1>
         <p id="dominican">
            This was the first time I went out of the country for anything. My brother was getting married and it was a destination wedding. 
            It was the first "all-inclusive" trip I had ever been on and it was honestly one of the coolest experiances I have had.
            The worst thing about the trip was honestly the <em>bugs</em>. They weren't huge, but they definitely swarmed. Bugs were in the room, my clothes, my hair,
            the restaurants, the hotel, etc. I was fully aware that this was their territory and I was the one invading and yet...
            I just couldn't get past that. Like I said before, it was still a cool trip, I even learned to drive a dune buggy through
            the towns and into the desert.

         <h2>Vegas <img></h2>
         <p id="Vegas">
            I've been to Vegas twice now and each time, it is amazing. 1 year I went for my bestfriends birthday.
            We had the most amazing time. I think that was my first time going actually. The reason I say it was a good trip is because 
            of this carousel we went on. I believe it was called a boozy carousel. For however long your time was, you had unlimited drinks.
            At the risk of sounding like an alcoholic, it really was one of the highlights of the trip.
            Not just because of the drinks, but it was a whole experiance. From the people on there with us, the drink combinations we tried, and the view,
            it was something to remember for a long while.

         <h3>Skydiving <img></h3>
         <p id="skydiving">
            This last one is not a trip but really just an amazing experiance. About 2 - 3 ago, I decided to go skydiving for my birthday.
            I really dont know why that was the first thing I thought of but it was one of craziest and most exciting things I have 
            ever done. I will say that I was definitely terrified right before the jump, although it was more of a fall,
            but I am glad I got to try it and I would do it again if the opportunity ever arose. It's actually one of the 
            highlights of my life and I'm always proud to say that I have done it at least once.
